Flexible optimization of arbitrary problems in Python.

The goal of this package is to provide advanced algorithmic support for arbitrary 
simulations/control systems with minimal required coding. Users can easily connect 
arbitrary evaluation functions to advanced algorithms with minimal coding with 
support for multi-threaded or MPI-enabled execution.

Currenty **Xopt** provides:

- optimization algorithms:
  - `cnsga` Continuous NSGA-II with constraints.
  - `bayesian_optimization` Single objective Bayesian optimization (w/ or w/o constraints, serial or parallel).
  - `mobo` Multi-objective Bayesian optimization (w/ or w/o constraints, serial or parallel).
  - `bayesian_exploration` Bayesian exploration.
- sampling algorithms:
  - `random sampler`
- Convenient YAML/JSON based input format.
- Driver programs:
  - `xopt.mpi.run` Parallel MPI execution using this input format.

Xopt does **not** provide: 
- your custom simulation via an `evaluate` function.

Configuring an Xopt run
===============
Xopt runs are specified via a dictionary that can be directly imported from a YAML file.

```yaml
xopt:
    max_evaluations: 6400

generator:
    name: cnsga
    population_size: 64
    population_file: test.csv
    output_path: .

evaluator:
    function: xopt.resources.test_functions.tnk.evaluate_TNK
    function_kwargs:
      raise_probability: 0.1

vocs:
    variables:
        x1: [0, 3.14159]
        x2: [0, 3.14159]
    objectives: {y1: MINIMIZE, y2: MINIMIZE}
    constraints:
        c1: [GREATER_THAN, 0]
        c2: [LESS_THAN, 0.5]
    linked_variables: {x9: x1}
    constants: {a: dummy_constant}
```


Using MPI
===============
Example MPI run, with `xopt.yaml` as the only user-defined file:
```b
mpirun -n 64 python -m mpi4py.futures -m xopt.mpi.run xopt.yaml
```

The complete configuration of a simulation optimization is given by a proper YAML file:






Defining evaluation function
===============
Xopt can interface with arbitrary evaluate functions (defined in Python) with the 
following form:
```python
evaluate(inputs: dict) -> dict
```
Evaluate functions must accept a dictionary object that **at least** has the keys 
specified in `variables, constants, linked_variables` and returns a dictionary 
containing **at least** the 
keys contained in `objectives, constraints`. Extra dictionary keys are tracked and 
used in the evaluate function but are not modified by xopt.




Installing Xopt
===============

Installing `xopt` from the `conda-forge` channel can be achieved by adding `conda-forge` to your channels with:

```shell
conda config --add channels conda-forge
```

Once the `conda-forge` channel has been enabled, `xopt` can be installed with:

```shell
conda install xopt
```

It is possible to list all of the versions of `xopt` available on your platform with:

```shell
conda search xopt --channel conda-forge
```



Developers
==========


Clone this repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/ChristopherMayes/Xopt.git
```

Create an environment `xopt-dev` with all the dependencies:
```shell
conda env create -f environment.yml
```


Install as editable:
```shell
conda activate xopt-dev
pip install --no-dependencies -e .
```

Install pre-commit hooks:
```
pre-commit install
```

The pre-commit hooks perform autoformatting and report style-compliance errors. 
* [ufmt](https://pypi.org/project/ufmt/) formats files w.r.t. [black](https://github.com/psf/black) a strict style enforcer, and [Î¼sort](https://usort.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), which sorts imports in Python modules.
* [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) confirms compliance. Occasionally black misses long-line comments/docstrings and they require manual format.

Pre-commit runs the hooks against your files. If the commit fails, correct the reported errors and then re-add the file with `git add my_file.py`.

### VSCode
The source control integration packaged with VSCode requires additional configuration. Git commands are run in the integrated terminal, which does not inherit the Python interpreter configured with the VSCode project thus breaking the pre-commit hooks. The integration terminal can be configured to use the conda Python environment by including a `.env` file in your project repository:

```
#!/usr/bin/bash 
source /path/to/xopt-dev/bin/activate
```
